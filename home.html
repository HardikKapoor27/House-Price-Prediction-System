        <p class="home-sub-heading">
          House Price Prediction uses data analysis and statistical models to estimate the market value of homes. 
          Key factors like house size, location, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and proximity to amenities 
          are evaluated to generate a reliable price estimate. This often leverages modern technologies like 
          machine learning to enhance accuracy and scalability.
